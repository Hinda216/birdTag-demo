# BirdTag - Technical Summary

## Project Overview
AI-powered pollinator monitoring system designed to support ecological research workflows, directly inspired by Monash University's bee tracking research.

**Note:** This system was originally developed as a full-stack application with AWS backend services and university-provided AI models. For this demo presentation, I adapted it to frontend-only while preserving all original functionality and API integration patterns.

## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **React 18 + TypeScript** - Type-safe, scalable component architecture
- **React Router** - Multi-page application with protected routes
- **Custom Hooks** - Reusable state management for file operations
- **Responsive CSS** - Mobile-first design with flexbox/grid layouts

### **Key Features Built**
1. **File Upload System** - Drag-and-drop with progress tracking and base64 conversion
2. **Search Engine** - Multi-modal search (tags, species, URL, file similarity)
3. **Tag Management** - AI detection + manual correction workflow
4. **Bulk Operations** - Select, edit, and delete multiple files
5. **Notification System** - Species-based email alert subscriptions

### **Data Management**
- **Local State Management** - Complex state for file operations and user interactions
- **Simulated API Integration** - Built to easily plug into backend services
- **Data Persistence** - localStorage integration for demo continuity

### **UI/UX Design Principles**
- **User-Centered Design** - Workflows based on actual researcher needs
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Simple tasks easy, complex tasks possible
- **Error Prevention** - Validation, confirmation dialogs, clear feedback
- **Consistent Patterns** - Unified design language throughout system

## Research Integration
- **Academic Foundation** - Based on AI bee tracking research from Ratnayake et al.
- **Practical Application** - Translates computer vision research into usable tools
- **Scalable Architecture** - Designed to handle large datasets and multiple users

## Development Approach
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Built functional demo in focused development cycles
- **Iterative Design** - User feedback incorporated into interface improvements
- **Documentation** - Code comments and component organization for maintainability

## Full-Stack Development Experience

### **Original Backend Integration** (Previous Implementation)
- **AWS S3** - File storage and thumbnail generation
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless API endpoints for file operations
- **AWS Cognito** - User authentication and session management
- **University AI Models** - Species detection and classification APIs
- **AWS SNS** - Email notification system for species alerts
- **DynamoDB** - Metadata storage for tags and file relationships

### **Frontend-Backend Communication**
- **RESTful API Design** - Clean endpoint structure for all operations
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based user sessions  
- **File Upload Pipeline** - Presigned URLs for direct S3 uploads
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections for AI processing status
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### **Demo Adaptation Process**
- **API Simulation** - Maintained exact same component interfaces
- **State Management** - Preserved original data flow patterns
- **Response Mocking** - Realistic API response simulation
- **Authentication Flow** - Simulated login states and user sessions

This approach demonstrates my ability to work with both integrated systems and standalone presentations.
